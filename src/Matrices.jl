    Y(traj::Matrix; p::Int64=1, T::Int64=100)

This function turns a trajectory `traj` which is a matrix with K rows into a matrix Y as defined
    in LÃ¼tkepohls book in equation (3.2.1). If `T+p` excedes the length of the trajectory, i.e.
    `traj` has less than `T+p` columns, then Y is retruned with `T = size(traj)[2]-p`. If on the 
    other hand the trajectory is longer than `T+p` then Y given by slicing the last `T` columns 
    out of `traj`.
